    The dogwifhat is a Meme started by <a href="https://twitter.com/issa">@Issa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SpoodahRL">@SpoodahRL</a>
    <p></p>
    This meme is about making dogs with unqiue hats and using them as your profile picture
    It created many communites, and discord servers with people sharing there dogs with hats
<p></p>
    The generator was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/RockCrafts">@RockCrafts</a> in order to help people make them easier
    and faster. Although this creates basic hats only, there are many people such as in,
    <a href="https://discord.dogwifahat.com">discord.dogwifahat.com</a>, that help make cool 3d custom hats such as the ones in <thead>
    featured dogs tab.
